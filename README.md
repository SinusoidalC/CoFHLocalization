============================

Localization for Thermal Expansion!

Always use the English (en_US) versions of the files as a default, since this will be the most up-to-date one.

Keep in mind that the .properties file _must_ be ISO 8859-1 encoded, usual UTF-8 will not work! For a good converter, go to http://code.cside.com/3rdpage/us/javaUnicode/converter.html.
